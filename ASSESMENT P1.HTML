			The company spun off its international operations into a separately traded company on December 1, 1964, known as "Hilton International Co.
			" It was acquired in 1967 by Trans World Corp., the holding company for Trans World Airlines.
			As a result, there were two separate, fully independent companies operating hotels under the Hilton name. 
			Because the two chains were contractually forbidden to operate hotels in the other's territory under the Hilton name, 
			for many years hotels run by Hilton International in the U.S. were called Vista International Hotels, while hotels operated by the American arm of Hilton outside the U.S. 
			were named Conrad Hotels. Those Hilton Hotels outside the U.S. were, until 2006, styled as "Hilton International" hotels. [55]

			In 1986, Hilton International was sold to UAL Corp., the holding company for United Airlines, for $980 million.[56] UAL was reorganized as Allegis Corp. 
			in an attempt to re-incarnate itself as a full-service travel company, encompassing Westin Hotels and Hertz rental cars in addition to Hilton International and United Airlines. 
			In 1987, after a corporate putsch, the renamed Allegis sold Hilton International to Ladbroke Group plc, a British leisure and gambling company, for $1.07 billion.[57] In May 1999,
			Ladbrokes was reorganized as "Hilton Group plc."[58]
